# Payment API Integration

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app). It serves as a foundational implementation for integrating payment APIs into web applications.

## Overview

The application demonstrates how to build a modern web application with Next.js while integrating payment functionalities. It includes features such as server-side rendering, optimized font loading, and a modular architecture to simplify the integration of third-party payment APIs.

## Getting Started

To run the application locally, follow these steps:

1. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    # or
    pnpm install
    ```

2. Start the development server:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    # or
    yarn dev
    # or
    pnpm dev
    # or
    bun dev
    ```

3. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to view the application.

You can begin customizing the application by editing the `app/page.tsx` file. Changes will be reflected in real-time.

## Features

- **Payment API Integration**: Easily integrate with popular payment gateways.
- **Next.js Framework**: Leverages the power of Next.js for server-side rendering and static site generation.
- **Optimized Fonts**: Uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), ensuring a polished and professional UI.
- **Modular Architecture**: Designed for scalability and maintainability.
